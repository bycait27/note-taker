# Note Taker

## Description

This is an application built with Node.js and Express.js. It is an app for taking notes via Heroku or a live server. This app was created to help the user keep track of things they need to do, small notes, or anything they might need to record and remember later! While creating this application, it helped me understand better how to connect the front end of an app to the back en of an app. I enjoyed going through this process and it was very nice to see it all come together.

## Installation

Install Express.js in order to run the server.

<!-- Heroku? -->

## Usage

Once the user has installed the appropriate packages, they will type "node server.js" into the terminal. This will display to the user a live server where they can interact with the notes app via a browser. Another way they can interact with the app is via Heroku. The user will first see the notes app with a "Get Started" button. When the user clicks on this button, they will be taken to a notepad where they can see their previously written notes. If they click the plus sign in the top right corner of the app, they can start a new note and then save it by clicking the save icon next to the add button. Their new note should then be displayed with their other notes.
